# Task 1


## Merge this repository into your fork/clone

[Github Merging into fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork)


## Solve GA_task.ipynb notebook

Implement a GA to extremize a polynomial within range.


# Neural Networks


## Visualization:

Youtube videos  - good, intuitive, in-depth

## Neural network made by google - Can understand hyper-parameter tuning

[Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org)


# Task 2

DEADLINE :: 20<sup>th</sup> June 2019


## Solve fill and solve neural_net.py file


### Resources:

-   <https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk>

-   <http://playground.tensorflow.org>


### Instructions:

There are 11 TODOS in this python file
Fill each one of those appropriately and you will have a working neural network
Instructions and resources have been provided wherever possible.
The implementation may not be perfect, so feel free to point out any mistakes / ask any doubts

After completing the task, some of the things you could try are (optional):

-   Implement different cost functions (binary cross-entropy)
-   Implement different activation functions (tanh, ReLU, softmax)
-   Incorporate these changes in the neural netwok code so that you can select the loss / activation function
-   Play with the hyper-paramters!
